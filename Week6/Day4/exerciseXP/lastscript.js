/**ðŸŒŸ Exercise 5 : Juice Bar

Instructions

You will use nested functions, to open a new juice bar.

Part I:

The outer function named makeJuice receives 1 argument: the size of the beverage the client wants - small, medium or large.

The inner function named addIngredients receives 3 ingredients, and displays on the DOM a sentence like The client wants a <size drink> juice, containing <first ingredient>, <second ingredient>, <third ingredient>".

Invoke the inner function ONCE inside the outer function. Then invoke the outer function in the global scope.


Part II:

In the makeJuice function, create an empty array named ingredients.

The addIngredients function should now receive 3 ingredients, and push them into the ingredients array.

Create a new inner function named displayJuice that displays on the DOM a sentence like The client wants a <size drink> juice, containing <first ingredient>, <second ingredient>, <third ingredient>".

The client wants 6 ingredients in his juice, therefore, invoke the addIngredients function TWICE. Then invoke once the displayJuice function. Finally, invoke the makeJuice function in the global scope.
