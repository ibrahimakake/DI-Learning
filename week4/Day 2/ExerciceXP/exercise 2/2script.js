function calculateTip(){
    const amount = Number (prompt("john, what's the amount of bill ?") )
   let tip;
  
    if (amount < 50){
        tip= amount*(20/100)
    }
       
    else if(amount > 50 && amount < 200 ){

        tip =  amount*(15/100)
    }
    
    else{
        tip=  amount*(10/100)
    }
    console.log("the bill is "+ amount + " and the tip is "+ tip)
