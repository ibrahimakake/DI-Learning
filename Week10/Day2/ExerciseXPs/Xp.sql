/*
ðŸŒŸ Exercise 1 : Items And Customers

Create a database called public.

Add two tables:
items
customers.


Follow the instructions below to determine which columns and data types to add to the two tables:

Add the following items to the items table:
1 - Small Desk â€“ 100 (ie. price)
2 - Large desk â€“ 300
3 - Fan â€“ 80

Add 5 new customers to the customers table:
1 - Greg - Jones
2 - Sandra - Jones
3 - Scott - Scott
4 - Trevor - Green
5 - Melanie - Johnson

Use SQL to fetch the following data from the database:
All the items.
All the items with a price above 80 (80 not included).
All the items with a price below 300. (300 included)
All customers whose last name is â€˜Smithâ€™ (What will be your outcome?).
All customers whose last name is â€˜Jonesâ€™.
All customers whose firstname is not â€˜Scottâ€™.

item_id serial primary key,
items varchar(50) not null ,
prices integer not null

select * from items where prices > 80

select * from items where prices <= 300

select * from customers

select * from customers where last_name ='Smith' /* Nothing will retrieve because 'Smith' does not exist in the table*/

select * from customers where last_name ='Jones'

select * from customers where first_name = 'Scott'
